## Attack 

### Sensitive Information 
- Usernames.
- Email Addresses.
- Passwords.
- DNS records.
- IP Addresses.
- Source code.
- Configuration files.
- PII.
### Source

|**Information Source**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Code`|This means that the already executed program code results are used as a source of information. These can come from different functions of a program.|
|`Libraries`|A library is a collection of program resources, including configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, prebuilt code and subroutines, classes, values, or type specifications.|
|`Config`|Configurations are usually static or prescribed values that determine how the process processes information.|
|`APIs`|The application programming interface (API) is mainly used as the interface of programs for retrieving or providing information.|
|`User Input`|If a program has a function that allows the user to enter specific values used to process the information accordingly, this is the manual entry of information by a person.|

### Processes

|**Process Components**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`PID`|The Process-ID (PID) identifies the process being started or is already running. Running processes have already assigned privileges, and new ones are started accordingly.|
|`Input`|This refers to the input of information that could be assigned by a user or as a result of a programmed function.|
|`Data processing`|The hard-coded functions of a program dictate how the information received is processed.|
|`Variables`|The variables are used as placeholders for information that different functions can further process during the task.|
|`Logging`|During logging, certain events are documented and, in most cases, stored in a register or a file. This means that certain information remains in the system.|

### Privileges
|**Privileges**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`System`|These privileges are the highest privileges that can be obtained, which allow any system modification. In Windows, this type of privilege is called `SYSTEM`, and in Linux, it is called `root`.|
|`User`|User privileges are permissions that have been assigned to a specific user. For security reasons, separate users are often set up for particular services during the installation of Linux distributions.|
|`Groups`|Groups are a categorization of at least one user who has certain permissions to perform specific actions.|
|`Policies`|Policies determine the execution of application-specific commands, which can also apply to individual or grouped users and their actions.|
|`Rules`|Rules are the permissions to perform actions handled from within the applications themselves.|
### Destination
|**Destination**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Local`|The local area is the system's environment in which the process occurred. Therefore, the results and outcomes of a task are either processed further by a process that includes changes to data sets or storage of the data.|
|`Network`|The network area is mainly a matter of forwarding the results of a process to a remote interface. This can be an IP address and its services or even entire networks. The results of such processes can also influence the route under certain circumstances.|
## General Troubleshooting

Depending on the Windows or Linux version we are working with or targeting, we may encounter different problems when attempting to connect to a service.

Some reasons why we may not have access to a resource:

- Authentication
- Privileges
- Network Connection
- Firewall Rules
- Protocol Support

Keep in mind that we may encounter different errors depending on the service we are targeting. We can use the error codes to our advantage and search for official documentation or forums where people solved an issue similar to ours.
