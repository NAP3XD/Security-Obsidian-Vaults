### Info

By using Process Hacker, we can observe a range of processes within our environment. Sorting the processes by name, we can identify interesting color-coded distinctions. Notably, "powershell.exe", a managed process, is highlighted in green compared to other processes. Hovering over powershell.exe reveals the label "Process is managed (.NET)," confirming its managed status.

Examining the module loads for `powershell.exe`, by right-clicking on `powershell.exe`, clicking "Properties", and navigating to "Modules", we can find relevant information.

The presence of "Microsoft .NET Runtime...", `clr.dll`, and `clrjit.dll` should attract our attention. These 2 DLLs are used when C# code is ran as part of the runtime to execute the bytecode. If we observe these DLLs loaded in processes that typically do not require them, it suggests a potential [execute-assembly](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/cobalt-strike-3-11-the-snake-that-eats-its-tail/) or [unmanaged PowerShell injection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tvfb9poTKg&ab_channel=RaphaelMudge) attack.

To showcase unmanaged PowerShell injection, we can inject an [unmanaged PowerShell-like DLL](https://github.com/leechristensen/UnmanagedPowerShell) into a random process, such as `spoolsv.exe`. We can do that by utilizing the [PSInject project](https://github.com/EmpireProject/PSInject) in the following manner.
